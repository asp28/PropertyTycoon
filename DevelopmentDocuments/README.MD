`sprints` is where all the editable documentation files are located. 


## Other Notes

We have used GitHub to upload and maintain our code base. The repository is found [here](https://github.com/asp28/PropertyTycoon).

We have used Trello to plan out our weekly sprints for what tasks were going to be performed for that week. The Trello board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/VlTDakv4/software-engineering-project)
