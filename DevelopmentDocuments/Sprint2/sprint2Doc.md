## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

- F1
  - The software shall implement a renting mechanism in which a player will pay a small fee for landing on an owned property. For any ownable property on the board, a non-negotiable, pre-determined fee must be paid to the owner of said property immediately after landing on said property. If a property is unowned, the player shall not pay a fee to the bank.
- F2
  - The software shall be displayed in a neat and efficient manner on the screen to the players. On this graphical interface, it shall display the current player's balance. In addition, there should be buttons which will in turn either roll the dice, buy a property or sell a property.
- F3
  - The software shall indicate on the GUI what actions the current player can perform. All actions up to this point are: rolling dice, buying a property, selling a property and ending their turn. For example if the player has rolled a non-double, the software should disable the action to roll again. On the contrary if the player rolls a double, the software should keep the action to roll again available.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- NF1
  - To contruct the graphical user interface (GUI) of the software, our team has chosen to use JavaFX based on the premise that everyone in our team has some knowledge of JavaFX. If in the future there is an easier alternative, the question will be posed in the weekly discussion meeting to determine whether to switch.

### Domain Requirements
- D1
    - We are unsure of how the system of rolling 3 doubles and going to jail should function. We will ask the customer on our next rendez-vous.
